## 4. Definition of Done
The following criteria must be met for a task or feature to be considered "done":
1. Code is fully developed and adheres to coding standards.
2. All unit tests and automated tests have passed.
3. Feature has been reviewed and approved by peers.
4. Functionality has been tested and confirmed to work as intended.
5. Documentation is updated if necessary.
6. Code is merged into the main branch, and all build pipelines have passed.
7. Feature is deployable to the production environment.

## 5. Team Approach to Work
The team adopts a collaborative and iterative approach:
- Break tasks into manageable units.
- Prioritize based on project needs.
- Assign ownership accordingly.
- Regular check-ins and clear communication.
- Peer reviews to ensure quality and promote continuous learning.
- Work in sprints, stay flexible, and focus on delivering value with each iteration.

## 6. Documentation and Artifact Storage
- **Google Drive**: For documentation requiring heavy editing.
  - [Shared Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/3/folders/1hMrZdfL0pOiByzCx4NsOfpCCc5e9Kj3B)
- **GitHub Repository**: For stable documentation.

## 7. Additional Agreements
### a. Handling Tasks Not Completed on Time
If a team member cannot complete a task on time:
- Respond with understanding and open communication.
- Encourage sharing challenges to discuss obstacles and potential solutions.
- Solutions may include redistributing tasks, offering help, or adjusting deadlines.
- Regular check-ins ensure transparency and team support.

### b. Code Contribution Process
- Use **separate branches with peer reviews** rather than pushing code directly to the main branch. This ensures code is thoroughly reviewed and tested, promoting collaboration and quality.

### c. Deployment to Heroku
- **Designate someone** for Heroku deployments instead of deploying after each push to GitHub. This ensures controlled, stable deployments and avoids deploying incomplete features or bugs.

### d. About submission of individual work
- If the person's role is developer, he should submit his work at least **2 days** before the sprint ends. This helps the scrum master and product owener to have more time to valdiate work and to submit MVP document.
